**Welcome to Theatre and Code!** This blog grew out of a fascination with two spheres of creation that at first glance have nothing to do with each other. The theatre is an ancient art that has penetrated cultures around the globe for centuries and centuries. Code, and specifically creative coding, only began in the mid-twentieth century.

So what can these widely different mediums learn from each other? What can we create by joining them? Hopefully this blog and these projects begin to claw at the answers to these questions. At this current juncture, I know very little about even starting to answer those questions. However, by musing and pondering and questioning, I hope to stumble upon at least one thought that can help produce a play or write some software (*dream big I know*).

I also hope that this will eventually reach other theatre artists and creative coders who wonder like I do. I hope that they will send me *their* questions, *their* findings, *their* projects. I believe in the immense power of collaboration and this blog will be nothing if it is but one person's incoherent ramblings.

```javascript

const prob = 0.5;
let rand = Math.random();

if (rand < prob) {
  alert('To be');
} else {
  alert('not to be');
}
